# RULER
_RULER_ is (will be) an automated installer, updater, and launcher for [_I.RULE_](https://doctorhummer.itch.io/irule). When launching _RULER_, if no installation is installed, _RULER_ will install the latest version. If a version is already installed, _RULER_ will check the file version and prompt an update instead. After this process has continued, _RULER_ will start an _I.RULE_ process.
